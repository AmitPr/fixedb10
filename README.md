# fixedb10

Fixed-point types for Rust, with base 10 (decimal) precision. This crate aims to provide a set of numeric types with guaranteed precision up to a certain number of decimal places, similar to the [`fixed` crate](https://crates.io/crates/fixed) but with base 10 precision specification, instead of base 2.

Aimed to be useful for financial applications, where precision is typically specified in decimal places, rather than bits.

Heavy work in progress, and not yet ready for use.
